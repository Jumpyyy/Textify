# Textify

Textify (comes from the prefix of "Text" and the suffix of "Classify") is a high-level framework using TensorFlow for text classification. While text classification is the main task of this toolkit, it is, also, has been designed to support different NLP tasks such as:

   * Text tagging.
   * Neural machine translation.


## Example:
Textify is used to implement the following models:
1. Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun. [Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626). NIPS 2015. You can find the implementation in this repo, [CharCNN](https://github.com/mhjabreel/CharCNN/tree/textify_based).

## Documentation
